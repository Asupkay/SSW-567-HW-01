1. What challenges did you encounter with this assignment if any?
> The biggest challenge for me was adapting my knowledge of JavaScript testing to Python testing. I was interested to interact with PyTest as I have heard quite a bit about its usability. Overall, the assignment was very straight forward
2. What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
> I think it was a bit general as there are triangles that can fit into multiple categories like a right triangle can also be scalene or isosceles.
3. What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
> No big challenges with the tools they seemed to work well. I found it interesting how it would automatically locate test cases by how the function name started.
4. Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
> The criteria I used to detemine that I had sufficient test cases was making sure I had a good mix of edge cases and regular cases. I distributed cases across each possible outcome from Scalene and to Right. From here I was able to discover some bugs that led me to think of more potential test cases. I followed this track till I felt I had covered all expected and unexpected output that were different cases from eachother.
